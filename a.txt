- create extraction folder

- on each css(/styled/global):
    - copy file to extraction folder
    - create uuid for the css
    - prepare css for execution:
        - change css import to "~execute-css"
        - add unique css id to first argument
            // before: import { css } from '@stitches'
            import { css } from '@stitches-execution

            // before: const myCss = css({ padding: 1 })
            const myCSS = css(uuid, { padding: 1 })

- execute:
    - create ts file that imports all files as side effects and emits executionResults and cssString
    - execute file as side process and retrive executionResults and cssString

- on each css:
    - change css import from "~execute-css" to "~extracted-css"
    - extract uuid from arguments
    - get execution result by uuid
    - replace css functions arguments with execution results
